Mordor

Mordor is a custom HTTP server built from scratch over raw TCP, created to understand how web servers work at a low level. It focuses on learning core concepts like sockets, request parsing, routing, and response generation without relying on high-level frameworks.

Goals

Learn how HTTP works internally

Implement TCP networking from scratch

Manually parse HTTP requests and build responses

Understand concurrency and connection handling

Serve static files and later host a simple React app

Status

Mordor is currently in the development phase.
It is not intended for production use—this is a learning and experimentation project.

Features (In Progress)

Raw TCP server

Basic HTTP request parsing

Simple routing

Text and static file responses

Connection lifecycle handling

Planned

Logging and debugging tools

Why “Mordor”?

Because this is where things get built the hard way.
