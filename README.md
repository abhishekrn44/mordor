Mordor
Mordor is a custom HTTP server built from scratch over raw TCP using Go, created to understand how web servers work at a low level. It focuses on learning core concepts like sockets, request parsing, routing, and response generation—without relying on high-level frameworks.
In true Lord of the Rings fashion: one server to rule them all, one server to bind them, one server to bring them all, and in the logs debug them.

*Goals*
Master how HTTP works internally
Build TCP networking from the ground up
Parse HTTP requests manually
Craft HTTP responses by hand
Tame concurrency and connection handling

*Status*
Mordor is currently in development.
It is not meant for production—this is a learning quest, not a battle-hardened fortress.

*Features (Forged So Far)*
Raw TCP server (forged in the fires of sockets)
Basic HTTP request parsing
Simple routing paths
Text and static file responses
Connection lifecycle management

*Planned (Yet to Be Forged)*
Static file hosting
Hosting a simple React app
Better error handling
Logging worthy of the Red Book of Westmarch

Why “Mordor”?
Because great power is not given lightly.
To build a server from nothing, you must walk into Mordor and write every line yourself.
